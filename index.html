        "Come friendly bombs and fall on Slough!\nIt isn't fit for humans now,\nThere isn't grass to graze a cow.\nSwarm over, Death!\n\nCome, bombs and blow to smithereens\nThose air-conditioned, bright canteens,\nTinned fruit, tinned meat, tinned milk, tinned beans,\nTinned minds, tinned breath.\n\nMess up the mess they call a town-\nA house for ninety-seven down\nAnd once a week a half a crown\nFor twenty years.\n\nAnd get that man with double chin\nWho'll always cheat and always win,\nWho washes his repulsive skin\nIn women's tears:\n\nAnd smash his desk of polished oak\nAnd smash his hands so used to stroke\nAnd stop his boring dirty joke\nAnd make him yell.\n\nBut spare the bald young clerks who add\nThe profits of the stinking cad;\nIt's not their fault that they are mad,\nThey've tasted Hell.\n\nIt's not their fault they do not know\nThe birdsong from the radio,\nIt's not their fault they often go\nTo Maidenhead\n\nAnd talk of sport and makes of cars\nIn various bogus-Tudor bars\nAnd daren't look up and see the stars\nBut belch instead.\n\nIn labour-saving homes, with care\nTheir wives frizz out peroxide hair\nAnd dry it in synthetic air\nAnd paint their nails.\n\nCome, friendly bombs and fall on Slough\nTo get it ready for the plough.\nThe cabbages are coming now;\nThe earth exhales."

        "Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?\nThou art more lovely and more temperate:\nRough winds do shake the darling buds of May,\nAnd summer’s lease hath all too short a date;\nSometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,\nAnd often is his gold complexion dimm'd;\nAnd every fair from fair sometime declines,\nBy chance or nature’s changing course untrimm'd;\nBut thy eternal summer shall not fade,\nNor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st;\nNor shall death brag thou wander’st in his shade,\nWhen in eternal lines to time thou grow’st:\n   So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,\n   So long lives this, and this gives life to thee."

        "Whose woods these are I think I know.\nHis house is in the village though;\nHe will not see me stopping here\nTo watch his woods fill up with snow.\n\nMy little horse must think it queer\nTo stop without a farmhouse near\nBetween the woods and frozen lake\nThe darkest evening of the year.\n\nHe gives his harness bells a shake\nTo ask if there is some mistake.\nThe only other sound’s the sweep\nOf easy wind and downy flake.\n\nThe woods are lovely, dark and deep,\nBut I have promises to keep,\nAnd miles to go before I sleep,\nAnd miles to go before I sleep."]
